# About Me

Hey there! I'm **Yash**, a **cybersecurity enthusiast** who loves automating stuff, breaking things (in a good way), and building cool tools.I spend most of my time tinkering with tech â€” from **cloud security** to **DevOps**, and everything in between.

Iâ€™m always up to something interesting â€” whether itâ€™s automating security workflows, building custom pentesting tools, or just improving my Linux setup. I like working with **AWS**, **Docker**, and **CI/CD pipelines**, but what I love the most is finding creative ways to solve problems.

### A Little More About Me

- **Cybersecurity** is my jam. Automated threat intelligence workflows, and configured **SIEM solutions** for real-time incident response.
- **DevOps & Automation**? Yep, Iâ€™ve built some solid pipelines with **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **Ansible** to make deployment a breeze.
- When Iâ€™m not at work, youâ€™ll find me exploring the **latest in cyber tools**, or playing around with **self-hosted projects**. Oh, and I also built my own **pentesting OS** â€” yeah, thatâ€™s a thing.

### Skills & Tools I Play With

- **Cybersecurity**: Web app and network pentesting, cloud security, SIEM & SOC ops
- **Cloud & DevOps**: **AWS**, **GCP**, **Azure**, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, CI/CD pipelines
- **Scripting**: Python, Bash, PowerShell, YAML (Basically, if it can be automated, Iâ€™m all in)
- **System Admin**: Linux (RHEL, Ubuntu, CentOS), Windows exploitation, network security

### What I Do When Iâ€™m Not Working

When Iâ€™m not coding or breaking things, Iâ€™m usually:
- **Hacking my home setup**: Iâ€™ve got a custom **home automation** system running (because why not?).
- **Exploring and Developing new tools**: Always learning new techniques, especially when it comes to **pentesting** and **hacking**.
- **Optimizing my workflow**: From customizing **AwesomeWM** to creating **neon-infused setups** â€” I love making things work faster and more efficiently.
