# Personal Notes Website

Welcome to the codebase behind my personal website, proudly hosted via GitHub Pages at [https://neonpunks.github.io/](https://neonpunks.github.io/).

This site is a curated collection of resources, notes, and tools across areas I work with daily:

- **Cyber Security**
- **DevOps and Automation**
- **Linux Systems**
- **ChatGPT Prompt Engineering**
- **Other Useful Technical Topics**

## What You’ll Find Here

The website covers everything from quick one-liners to detailed how-to guides — whether you are setting up a hacking VPS, building a custom Docker image, or just need a fast AWS command reference without digging through pages of documentation.

You’ll also find a dedicated section for ChatGPT prompts. These are real-world-tested prompts that make ChatGPT significantly sharper, faster, and more technically capable. If you rely on AI for development, security, or system design tasks, these prompts will help you get more out of every session.

## Using the ChatGPT Prompts

Getting started is simple:

1. Copy the prompt you want to use.
2. Replace my name with yours wherever it appears.
3. In the next message to ChatGPT, just type `commands` or `help` and hit Enter.

This triggers a built-in guide explaining what the prompt can do and how to get the most out of it.  
The “Zero Prompt” included here is optimized for handling a wide range of technical workflows with minimal tweaking.

## Final Thoughts

This project is an ongoing effort. My goal is to keep this site practical, to the point, and filled only with things that actually make a difference in real-world projects.  
If it saves you even five minutes a day, it's doing its job.
